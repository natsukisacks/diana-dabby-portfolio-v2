        <h1>Patents & Trademarks Arising from the CantoVario Project, Issued by
        the USPTO</h1>

        <p>The following Intellectual Property (IP) arose from my work developing the CantoVario Projects.  This
        interdisciplinary work harnesses chaotic system variability to produce
        musical variation.  In wearing an engineer’s hat capped by a musician's, I devised engines for making musical variations of original works.  Based on a
        natural mechanism for variability found in dissipative chaotic systems,
        i.e., the sensitivity of their solutions to initial conditions, these engines typically employ two chaotic trajectories that map the events
        of a musical work into a variation based on the original piece. The
        variations can be close to the original, diverge from it substantially,
        or achieve degrees of variability between these two extremes.  The
        technique can serve as an idea generator or as a springboard for a
        dynamic music where a work changes from one hearing to the next—not in
        random ways—but rather by musical choice.  The technique does not
        generate music or any other kind of data as random events; rather, it
        creates a rich set of variations on an already completed piece or
        sequence of symbols.</p>

        <p>Despite its ability to produce variations that can be
        delightful—appealing to musicians and non-musicians alike—the original
        chaotic mapping of my earlier IP and papers had limitations.  For
        instance, it only encompassed one algorithm, whereas the “improved
        chaotic mapping” described in my 2016 patents offers multiple variation
        techniques, and uses them to generate variations not only of a
        discrete-time signal representation of a source piece, e.g., MIDI file
        scores, prose, poetry, etc., but also variations of continuous-time
        signal representations of a work, e.g., audio recording, film, video,
        spoken word art, video games, and so on.</p>

        <p>The patent applications (granted and pending) listed in the
        accompanying curriculum vitae cover my algorithms for generating musical
        variation.  Together they underpin the MIDI and audio
        sides of applications I’ve developed—known collectively as “CantoVario.”
        My 2010 Provisional, 2011 Utility, and 2012 Preliminary Amendment patent
        applications were issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and
        Trademark Office) in March 2016.  On the advice of my team at the MIT
        Venture Mentoring Service (VMS), I filed trademark applications to
        register the marks “CantoVario” and “EnginArt” with the USPTO (granted
        2014 and 2015, respectively), as well as the 2014 Continuation in Part
        (granted 2016).</p>

        <p>A utility patent awarded in June 2020
        covers variation  algorithms that produce
        the mash-ups currently on www.cantovario.com.  They're based on a 
        breakthrough idea that occurred to me one morning in June 2017, enabling complete mashups of songs, so that
        the mashups themselves constitute fully formed songs.  N.B:  A mashup is a form of
        musical variation; e.g., J.S. Bach wrote a mashup for the 30th variation
        of his Goldberg Variations.</p>

        <p>In sum, the patents (and trademarks) arising from the CantoVario Projects show work recognized by the
        National Science Foundation (NSF), the MIT Venture Mentoring Service
        (VMS), the USPTO, the journal <em>Science</em>, and most recently a 2024-25 Harvard Radcliffe Fellowship.  Like the <em>Science</em> article,
        they fuse the disciplines of music and engineering.  The
        thematic table below captures the role played by each of my three
        overarching themes (lifelong learning, intrinsic motivation, the creative process) in devising and writing these patents.  </p>
