        orchestral arrangements that can be accessed at <a
        href="https://pages.olin.edu/eco-summer2019" target="_blank">The Engineers’
        Conductorless Orchestra Hub</a>, a website offering useful resources,
        videos, orchestral arrangements, and blueprints to help/encourage other
        engineering schools to start their own conductorless orchestras, as
        discussed throughout this page.</p>
        
        <p>Students in the Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO) select their own
        repertoire.  In general, they favor big romantic pieces typically played
        by 70+ musicians (~50 strings and 24 wind/brass/percussion).  But Olin
        has a small student body which has resulted in  nontraditional
        instrumentation since OCO’s inception in Fall 2002.  This means every piece must be
        re-orchestrated to suit each semester’s available instruments.  For
        example, OCO winds and brass can outnumber the strings, and vice versa,
        so balance has to be achieved through often unorthodox means.</p>   

        <p>My 140+ arrangements have enabled a small school like Olin to have an
        orchestra, despite OCO’s eclectic instrumentation. They
        can also help other engineering schools form their own
        orchestras since these schools will likely lack a full complement of
        standard instruments comprising their string, wind, and brass sections.
        The arrangements are portable to other engineering schools via the
        Engineers’ Conductorless Orchestra website Hub, an externally-facing
        site with the mission of helping others outside the Olin community
        actualize the conductorless orchestra model.</p>
            
        <p><b>Explanatory notes for the OCO re-orchestrations (arrangements of
        symphonic works).</b> In creating these arrangements, I strive to make
        OCO sound as full and varied as possible, with a wide dynamic range,
        different colorations, strategic doublings, and effective solos/duets.
        Yet constraints exist, e.g., the comfort ranges of the OCO musicians.
        Simply substituting one instrument isn’t an option:  given the eclectic
        instrumentation of the last 22 years, a great group sound has to be
        created by imaginative voice leading, unorthodox doubling (e.g., violins
        with glockenspiel), timbral sleight-of-hand (e.g., blending a tenor sax
        into an 18th century symphony), and other means. </p>

        <p>Here is a short summary of my process for creating orchestral
        arrangements for the Olin Conductorless Orchestra. (The specific
        re-orchestrations mentioned below are elaborated further in <a
        href="../website-documents/supplementary-materials/music-supplementary/orchestral-arrangements/A-IV-K-1-orchestral-arrangements.pdf"
        target="_blank">this document</a>).</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>At the start of each semester I ask students for their
            comfortable high and low <em>forte</em> notes and high/low
            <em>piano</em> notes.  These often dictate what I can and cannot do,
            resulting in re-orchestrations particular to student
            instrumentalists.  This is one of the reasons why my arrangements
            may be useful to other engineering schools wishing to start their
            own conductorless orchestras.</li>
            
            <li>Instrumental, sectional (strings, winds, brass, percussion), and
            orchestral voice leading.  For example, taking a high passage
            written for the violins and moving it down an octave, which often
            necessitates moving other string and wind parts down an octave, then
            bringing them back into their intended ranges in a smooth manner
            with good voice leading.</li> 
            
            <li>Stylistic intent of the composer.  Having performed many Haydn,
            Mozart, and Beethoven piano sonatas, as well as myriad romantic
            works, I’ve assimilated a wide array of styles.  For example, I
            created an arrangement of Haydn’s Symphony No. 48 (first movement)
            that evoked the classic style through an artful blend of three
            clarinets, two flutes, and a tenor sax with strings, instead of
            Haydn’s wind section of two oboes and a bassoon.</li>
                
            <li>Contrapuntal and harmonic practice of the composer, e.g., for a
            piece in E minor, replacing the low B1 dominant of the double basses
            with B2 (since we have no double basses), but approaching the B2 in
            a stylistically smooth manner, as occurs multiple times in my
            arrangement of the Dvorak Ninth.</li>
                
            <li>Nontraditional instrumentation, i.e., instruments typically not
            found in an orchestra such as piano and saxophone (e.g., my
            arrangement of the Berlioz “Marche Hongroise”), an over-abundance of
            clarinets—or none at all—as can be heard in my arrangements of
            Haydn’s Symphony No. 48 and Gershwin’s <em>An American in Paris</em>,
            respectively.  Frequently I’ll compensate an over-abundance of a
            given instrument (such as flute) by combining each of the ‘too many
            flutes’ with other instruments to create hybrid instruments that
            hide the recognizable flute timbre (as I did with <em>An American in
            Paris</em>).  At other times, I’ll score the non-traditional instrument
            (e.g., tenor sax) in a register where it will blend best with the
            other instruments to create a coherent group sound (as with Haydn’s
            Symphony No. 48).</li>
                
            <li>Non-standard ratios of violins, violas, and cellos.  Strings
            characteristically present a homogeneous section which helps when
            there isn’t enough of a given instrument.  But what happens when OCO
            has six violins and only one cello (as occurred in Spring 2019)?
            Depending on context, I doubled the cello with alto sax and/or
            brass, and even with violins, as can be heard in the Berlioz “Marche
            Hongroise.”</li>
                
            <li>Non-standard ratios of winds and brass.  As an example, Mozart
            wrote his Wind Serenade, K. 361, for 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 basset
            horns, 4 horns, 2 bassoons, and double bass.  But during Spring
            2019, OCO had none of these instruments; instead, we had 3 flutes,
            an alto sax, trumpet, euphonium, and trombone.  I created an
            arrangement for these instruments, and wrote extra parts for our
            pianist and timpanist so they could join the section.</li>            
                
            <li>Untenable writing for too few instruments, e.g., the Dvorak
            Eighth with only three violins to sustain stratospheric writing
            intended for a full first violin section.  As another example, in
            his Ninth Symphony Dvorak wrote climactic passages that take the
            first violin section—typically 16–18 players—ever higher. But in
            Spring 2016, OCO only had six violins. Though some of the OCO
            violinists could technically play these parts, the results would
            have been thin and anticlimactic in comparison with the intended
            large violin section of the orchestra which gave its 1893 world première
            (Philharmonic Society of New York).  So to achieve these climactic
            passages, I scored the stratospheric lines for both glockenspiel and
            piano (right hand in octaves), doubled at the octave below by all
            six violins so that their overtones would support the glockenspiel
            (a high bell-like instrument) and piano.</li>
                
            <li>Giving students solos, as can be heard in all the OCO YouTube
            recordings.  For example, in <em>An American in Paris</em>, I often
            re-distributed solos, originally written for one instrument, among
            several players.  I frequently give the recapitulation of a solo to
            another member of the orchestra, or re-allocate who gets the top
            line, e.g., flute1 and flute2 customarily play the higher and lower
            flute parts, respectively, but I often switch them to provide more
            variety for the players, as can be heard in all my arrangements for
            OCO.</li>
                
            <li>Reduction from 90+ player orchestrations to 10-22 player
            arrangements (e.g., the 24 wind/brass instruments required for
            <em>An American in Paris</em> vs. the eight available in OCO ), or
            an increase in forces, as from a wind ensemble to a mixed
            wind/brass/percussion/piano ensemble (e.g., Mozart’s <em>Serenade in
            Bb for Winds</em>, K. 361).</li>
                
            <li>Balance issues, i.e., non-standard numbers of wind, brass, and
            strings comprising their respective sections, as have occurred and
            been addressed in all my arrangements, e.g., <em>An American in
            Paris</em> and <em>Danzon No. 2</em> by Arturo Marquez, to name but
            two.</li>
            
            <li>Creating the impression of large forces through changes in
            dynamics, color contrasts, decreasing/increasing texture, among
            other strategies.  OCO typically likes ‘big’ works, such as
            <em>Danzon No. 2</em>, the <em>Dvorak Ninth Symphony</em>, and
            <em>An American in Paris</em>, among others.</li>
                
            <li>I try to give each student a good part that speaks to
            his/her/their strengths, while also challenging weaker aspects of an
            individual’s playing (provided the student shows a commitment to
            mastering an earlier part).   I also try to give each at least one
            challenging part so they can ‘rise to the occasion’, hopefully
            paving the way for additional challenging parts.  When material is
            repeated, I’ll often vary the orchestration with each repetition
            (e.g., the Berlioz “Marche Hongroise”) or when duets/trios allow, I
            switch players in and out, thereby distributing parts (e.g.,
            Gershwin’s <em>American in Paris</em> at rehearsal 67).</li>
                
            <li>And finally, something I always try to do:  everyone plays at
            the end of a piece—at least one note!</li>
        </ul>

            arrangements, showing how I created stylistic consistency and a coherent

            <p><b>In sum</b>, by creating orchestral arrangements for the Olin
            Conductorless Orchestra, I sought to not only establish its viability but also support goals of developing students, providing external impact, and
            building & sustaining the College (Map 1).  These arrangements enabled
            our students and community to have an orchestra for the past 22
            years—despite an eclectic array of instruments—an orchestra
            that has helped students grow, both as players and listeners; an
            orchestra that has had a positive impact on prospective students, their
            families, and wider communities outside Olin; an orchestra that by
            virtue of its being conductorless has contributed to Olin’s reputation
            for innovation in engineering education.  Thus, though this project lies in
            the music space, it also inhabits the engineering space (Map 2).  The
            table below captures the role played by each of my three overarching
