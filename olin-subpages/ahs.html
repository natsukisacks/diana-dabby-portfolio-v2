        <h1>Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences (AHS) Curriculum Development
        (Music)</h1>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <div>
            <p>I have served on the AHS Committee at Olin since 2000, e.g.,
            chairing the AHS Search Committee in 2000 when we hired
            Prof. Robert Martello whose field is History of Science
            and Technology.  I created AHS courses—both disciplinary and
            interdisciplinary—specifically designed for the Olin student and
            helped incorporate effective written communication into our AHS
            Foundation Courses, with particular emphasis on evidence-based
            analysis.</p>
    
            <p>Not wanting to redefine what already existed at our
            neighboring partner institutions, I designed courses that spoke
            directly to the Olin student. For example, the Olin Conductorless
            Orchestra (OCO) is the only orchestra composed entirely of student
            engineers in the nation—and it functions without a conductor, on
            purpose. The Wired Ensemble takes engineers on a tour of the
            orchestra, including voice.  After learning about each family of
            instruments, they write music for these instruments and voices.  In
            both these disciplinary courses, students learn by doing,
            supported by the three overarching themes that pervade my
    work (Map 3).</p>
    
            <p>The below music courses bring “balance”, “creative energy”, and
            “emotional connection” to our students (their descriptors), not only
            developing the “whole person” which Prof. Lynn Andrea Stein
            often spoke about in the first year of the College (AY 00-01), but
            also displaying these traits to prospective students and their
            families, as seen in the “Music Program Impact” video links given in
            the <a href="music-program.html">Building a Music Program from
            Scratch</a> page. These short videos conveying the scope and impact
            of the music program show that Olin doesn’t just talk the talk, but
            walks the walk.</p>
    
            <p>These courses have also brought musical opportunities for Babson
            and Wellesley students.  For example, we were fortunate to have
            Stella Joo as a clarinetist in OCO during her four years at Babson
            College. She wrote the following letter upon graduating Babson:</p>
    
            <div style="margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px; font-size:
            14px;"> 
                <p>Hi Diana,</p>
    
                <p>I visited your office on Friday morning, but you must have
                stepped out for a moment when I was there. I didn't get to see
                you in person, but I just wanted to thank you one more time for
                the great experience I had with OCO. My college experience would
                not have been the same without OCO and your support along the
                way. It was a great way to explore and learn beyond the
                "business bubble" I had on Babson campus. I have always played
                music since I was young, whether it be a piano, a violin, or a
                clarinet, and I am so happy I had the opportunity to continue
                playing music in college. I am hoping to find an amateur
                orchestra in the Northern Virginia or DC area to join so I can
                continue to have music as part of my life even when I start work
                in September. Although I didn't get to play in an orchestra
                while I was in Singapore, there were so many opportunities to
                attend concerts throughout the semester, one of which was hosted
                by Singapore Symphony Orchestra with a guest pianist from Japan
                playing Rhapsody in Blue! Thank you so much for the past four
                years and I would love to keep in touch. I hope you have a
                wonderful summer.<p>
                <p>Best, <br>
                Stella Joo</p>

        <h3>I. The Olin Conductorless Orchestra: Offered Every Semester,
        2002-Present</h3>
    
        <div>
            <p class="fw-bold">What in the life of an Engineering
            School makes a conductorless orchestra possible?</p>
            
            <p>Firstly, a universal call throughout industry for engineering
            graduates who can work well in teams, assume, leadership, and
            communicate effectively.  At Olin, these were founding precepts of
            the College.  During the first week of meetings in Fall 2000 when
            Olin’s Founding Faculty of 12 sat together and started discussing
            possible avenues for the curriculum, these three professional skills
            were front and center.</p>
    
            <p>They were weighted heavily because the National Academy of
            Engineering and industry were insisting that engineers of the 21st
            century be multi-dimensional, i.e., comfortable not only with
            working on multidisciplinary projects in large global teams but also
            poised to assume leadership and communicative roles.  Much more
            would be expected and demanded of 21st century engineers than what
            had previously sufficed due to globalization and the exploding tech
            revolution.</p>
    
            <p>Secondly, a well-known, if anecdotal, truism across many nations
            is that students gifted in math and science are often talented in
            music.  Citing this, the Olin College Dean of Admission’s first
            question to a newly hired Assistant Professor of Electrical
            Engineering and Music during the summer of 2000 was, “Okay, where’s
            the Olin Orchestra?”  This wasn’t on my “to do” list nor in my
            contract.  But the new Dean, Dr. Charles Nolan, had researched
            Engineering Admissions, concluding that an orchestra would be
            essential for a college that did not exist yet because of the
            often-observed math/music connection.  (N.B.  Olin’s inaugural class
            of students matriculated in the fall of 2002 and graduated in 2006.)
            But instead of a conducted orchestra, I wondered if it made more
            sense for our new college to create a conductorless orchestra, given
            the call for engineers who can work in teams, and communicate
            effectively, both of which are essential for good leadership.</p>
    
            <p>A conductorless orchestra is first and foremost a large team
            collaboration by individuals working toward a high performance goal.
            By design, no overarching figure exists to sculpt an interpretation
            and pull the performance together. Rather, the members themselves
            bring the concert to fruition. Such an orchestra exerts singular
            demands on each individual during rehearsals and performances: the
            musicians must actively listen to their parts within the context of
            a larger whole and adjust accordingly, without being told by a
            conductor.</p>
    
            <p class="fw-bold">So what does a conductorless orchestra offer
            an engineering school?</p>
            
            <p>In short, an experiential project-based learning lab for
            developing 21st century professional skills, i.e., leadership,
            teamwork, and effective communication.These professional skills will
            be discussed further in <a
            href="../music-eng-subpages/engineers-orch.html">The Engineers’
            Conductorless Orchestra</a>.</p>
    
            <p class="fw-bold">How does the Olin Conductorless Orchestra
            develop students?</p>
            
            <p>OCO is the only conductorless orchestra composed of engineers—in
            the world.  It features engineering students in leadership,
            teamwork, and communicative roles.  Dedicated to performing the
            symphonic literature in the concerted spirit of chamber music, the
            orchestra forges individual participation, active listening, and
            group-motivation into performances that have established it as a
            singular ensemble.  With an essentially flat hierarchy that
            incorporates an ever-evolving sense of culture and cooperation as a
            working ensemble, OCO functions as an effective team of
            musicians—regardless of position—comprising students, faculty, and
            external guests, all dedicated to making the best music possible.
            As a result, everyone pulls their weight, especially necessary in an
            orchestra of 10-22 players where each instrumentalist is often
            carrying a line intended for many. Thus, every musician is both
            soloist and ensemble player.</p>
    
            <p>As an academic course at Olin, OCO works on the project-based
            learning (PBL) model:  students effectively operate the classroom,
            tapping their own intrinsic motivation, and I function as a
            professional guide-on-the-side.  As the faculty guide, I play
            several roles with responsibilities similar to those described by
            Wilfred Drath and Charles Palus in Making common sense: Leadership
            as meaning-making in a community of practice.   These can be
            summarized as doing whatever it takes to help the ensemble reach its
            goals and maintain standards.</p>
    
            <p>The members of the orchestra fill various roles such as
            ‘rehearsal leaders’, ‘navigators’, and ‘transcribers’.   In the past, each
            student signed up as a rehearsal leader for two rehearsals per
            semester.  Rehearsal leaders helped set the agenda for the upcoming
            rehearsal in conjunction with the navigators and faculty guide.  But students decided to discontinue this practice in 2022.  Since then, the navigators and I have set the agenda for each rehearsal.  
            <p></p>
            Section leaders emerge by consensus from each of the string, wind,
            brass and percussion sections.  The two navigators, elected by the
            full orchestra as overall leaders, work with me to ensure rehearsals
            run smoothly and communication lines stay open within the group.  For each new piece selected by OCO,
            student transcribers input the original score into Sibelius, a music
            notation program.  I then re-orchestrate the original
            score to suit OCO’s instrumentation for any given semester.  Each re-orchestration 
            (orchestral arrangement) re-designs a work for a different set of
            instruments.  This is necessary because the students often select
            works originally written for orchestras with 90+ players.  Thus,
            these pieces have to be re-composed for much smaller ensembles of
            10-22 musicians playing an eclectic array of instruments (see <a
            href="../music-subpages/orch-arrangements.html">Orchestral
            Arrangements</a>). Because I’m aware of the capabilities and
            aspirations of each member of the orchestra, I’m able to tailor the
            re-orchestrations to the strengths and motivation of individual
            players and the orchestra as a whole.</p>
    
            <p>Since Fall 2006, I’ve brought in external guests—musicians
            external to Olin who play professionally in the Boston area—so that
            student musicians hear additional perspectives on the music at hand.
            OCO musicians work together with the navigators,
            transcribers, faculty guide, and external guests to create a
            meaningful musical experience not only for the orchestra but also
            for its audiences.</p>
    
            <p>“Just in time learning” is delivered by the
            rehearsal leaders, orchestra members, as well as the faculty guide
            and external guests—all of which provide preparation/scaffolding.
            Students select their own repertoire before any music is learned
            which enhances their motivation to play the music well, e.g.,
            schedule individual practice.   (In conducted orchestras, the
            conductor often selects repertoire).  Students offer feedback via
            effective oral communication on the rehearsal process in real time,
            and via email in preparation for the next rehearsal.   The musicians
            work in one large group comprising all sections of the
            orchestra—winds, brass, strings, and percussion—as well as in
            smaller group sectionals consisting of a single instrumental family (e.g., a string sectional, wind sectional, etc.), or sectionals comprising high, mid, and low instrumental registers. Students teach one
            another since each brings a level of expertise
            to the music-making process. </p>  
    
            <p>The following analogies can be made between the conductorless
            orchestra ‘lab’ and a hands-on engineering lab.  As preparation for
            the hands-on lab (i.e., application via an upcoming performance),
            students take a Pre-Lab test (individual practice to learn parts),
            assimilate just-in-time learning (listen to recordings and analyze
            the music), complete a Virtual Lab (rehearse the music) and hands-on
            lab (concert performance).</p>
    
            <p>As a final step in the hands-on lab, students take a Post-Lab
            test. This corresponds to the orchestra listening to the concert
            recordings and dedicating follow-up rehearsals to address issues
            that require additional work in preparation for the next
            performance. In essence, this revision process guides musical
            growth, thus providing stimulation/impetus.</p>
    
            <p>In collaborating with each other, sometimes intensely and often
            with humor, the orchestra has risen to higher levels since
            its inception in fall 2002. OCO has been able to rise to these
            higher levels due to an appreciation for leadership, skill,
            compromise, dialog, and respect for others. Furthermore, the
            students in OCO have consistently included some of Olin’s finest
            engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, as observed by other
            faculty.</p>
    
            <p class="fw-bold">Why is the Olin Conductorless Orchestra
            important for Olin College?</p>
            
            <p>OCO is Olin’s oldest music ensemble and provides an enduring
            example of what our college represents. The orchestra has been a
            vehicle for talented students studying engineering since 2002, and
            shows the Renaissance side of their education. It has helped build &
            sustain the College by attracting excellent students (as
            remarked by faculty) through its visible performances for
            internal and external constituencies: 143 concerts, Fall 2002 – March 6, 2020. Two online events, 2021. One online event plus 21 live concerts Fall 2021 - Spring 2024.</p>
    
            <p>Some significant changes include those we made to OCO for Fall 2012 (including a new Action
            Plan and Group Auditions) that led to a contagious esprit de corps.  OCO attracted additional instrumentalists during
            AY13-14, including first-years, an excellent clarinetist from Babson
            College, and Olin seniors.  This trend continued in AY14-15 and AY
            15-16, at which point I realized it was time to take OCO on the road
            so students could experience playing in venues outside Olin College.
            We started with Powers Hall at the Needham Town Hall in Fall 2016,
            followed by the Great Hall of the Cooper Union in New York in Spring
            2017, the Mount Pleasant Retirement Home in Brookline in Spring
            2018, and OCO’s first jet ride to perform at the ASEE (American
            Society for Engineering Education) Zone 1 International Conference
            in Niagara Falls in Spring 2019, captured below.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold">My role in a conductorless orchestra</p>
            
            <p>I created the Olin Conductorless Orchestra to give our new school
            a bold variation on the collegiate student orchestra—an orchestra
            that is self-directed.  Its longevity and success have depended not
            only on a lasting commitment on my part, and that of our students,
            but also on the many skills I bring to its rehearsals and
            performances.  OCO continually taps all musical parts of me:  the
            concert pianist who knows how to craft, rehearse, and project an
            interpretation; the theorist who can support that interpretation by
            reasoning from a deep understanding of harmony and counterpoint; the
            orchestrator who has professionally performed all musical styles
            from the Baroque to modern times, applying this experience to the
            creation of stylistically-consistent orchestral arrangements; the
            composer whose imagination can conjure up novel orchestral
            arrangements of works written for orchestras four times our size,
            thus creating a coherent group sound despite an eclectic, unbalanced
            array of instruments; and the musician who can hear when things go
            awry and fix them on the spot, devising productive solutions,
            sometimes minutes away from performance time.  As I’ve done for the
            past 22 years, I’m dedicated to furthering OCO’s impacts on both its
            students and audiences.</p>
    
            <p>The following are two short performance clips of OCO from 2014
            and 2018, as well as earlier performance clips from 2003-05 to show
            growth of the orchestra.</p>

            <p>The 2018 recording shows how much the orchestra has grown since
            its formation in fall 2002 with five students and myself at the
            piano. In the early years of the college, OCO performances had to
            include sizeable piano parts, as can be heard in the below 2003-05
            performance clips. These large piano parts were necessary: they
            provided the glue bridging drastically unbalanced orchestral
            sections. For example, in fall 2003 we had four trombones and only
            one violin!</p>

        <h3>II. THE WIRED ENSEMBLE:  INSTRUMENTS, VOICES, PLAYERS (OFFERED EVERY
        FALL TERM, 2003 - PRESENT)</h3>
        <div>
            <p>As an AHS Foundation course in music, the Wired Ensemble must
            meet certain criteria that we have developed as an AHS faculty.
            Chief among these is written communication, especially analytical
            writing based on close reading, thesis development, and evidential
            support for a given thesis.  In this Foundation course, students
            simultaneously pursue composition with music and composition with
            text, including story/narrative writing.</p>
    
            <p>What’s special about the Wired Ensemble?  Is it the only music
            composition course in the nation where engineering students who have
            never composed music study orchestration and then compose for those
            instruments and voices?  Probably.  Is it the only music composition
            course in the nation where students apply analytical music
            composition tools—such as motivic development—not only to their
            pieces but also to the works of masters?  I hope not!   </p>
    
            <p>The Wired Ensemble cycles through a new instrumental family every
            two weeks.  There are four 100-minute classes devoted to each family
            or group of instruments:  woodwinds, brass, strings, and
            percussion/voice.</p> 
    
            <p>For each instrument family, students provide feedback on one
            another’s compositions and receive feedback and other forms of
            scaffolding, e.g., guided learning materials that encourage
            self-teaching, as well as individual sessions
            with me where I play their pieces at the piano, giving feedback (pro
            and con).  For the latter, I improvise solutions for any ‘problem’
            areas by first explaining what the problem is, followed by ways to
            solve it.  Students then revise their work in preparation for a live
            performance class that features other student musicians as
            performers of their compositions.  In this way, students not only
            hear their original compositions on live instruments but also gain
            firsthand experience about what works well (and perhaps not so well)
            based on feedback from performers, peers, professor, and their own
            ears.  To give students useful tools for composition, we build a
            Composer’s Toolkit.  Each week I stuff the Toolkit with new
            compositional tools and demonstrate these at the piano using a
            number of musical examples culled from the literature.  These tools
            help students advance their own compositional and creative
            processes.  To reinforce the Toolkit, I developed a series of
            “Creative Inquiries” where students apply, and gain experience with,
            useful compositional techniques (stimulation/impetus and
            application) such as motivic development. By the end of eight weeks,
            students are ready for a “longer rope”:  they compose their “dream
            piece”, that piece they’ve always wanted to write, thus tapping
            intrinsic motivation.   Continuing to stuff the Wired Composer’s
            Toolkit, I now present techniques associated with the concept of
            Developing Variation, e.g., linkage, thematic transformation,
            metrical displacement, and motivic development.  These techniques
            find their way into students’ Final Project pieces (again,
            stimulation/impetus and application) which are featured in the Wired
            Ensemble Event concert during Olin’s December Exposition (Fall
            Expo).  The Composer’s Toolkit pervades other aspects of the course,
            especially written communication.  Students write short analyses of
            their own pieces, then a longer analysis paper on “Beethoven’s
            Creative Process:  peering into an 1803 sketchbook.”  We conclude
            with written personal narratives about their connection to
            music and/or an analysis of a text written by Beethoven, e.g., the Immortal
            Beloved letter or his Heiligenstadt Testament.
            For written assignments, students can make the connection between musical
            composition tools and literary composition tools.  Analogies abound,
            e.g., musical articulations ↔ textual punctuation, non-harmonic
            tones ↔ diction (word choice), and so on.</p>   
    
            <p>In sum, as a disciplinary course in music, the Wired Ensemble
            develops students through three overarching themes of lifelong
            learning, intrinsic motivation, and the creative process
            (encompassing stimulation/impetus, preparation/scaffolding,
            application, feedback, revision, and effective communication).  As
            an AHS Foundation course, it has contributed to the AHS curriculum
            and helped build the student body by attracting prospective students
            through its many performances (88 concerts, Fall 2003 – Spring
            2024, plus 2 online events during the pandemic).</p>

            <p>As a result of my funded Babson-Olin-Wellesley Presidential
            Innovation Grant (“Mix and Stir”, part 2), Wired Ensemble students
            had the opportunity to hear their works performed live by a
            Wellesley College faculty trio (Gabriela Diaz, violin; David
            Russell, cello; and Lois Shapiro, piano) on December 5, 2017.  (I
            had hoped to include student compositions by Wellesley music
            students as well, but they were at work on other projects, so only
            Wired Ensemble works were performed.)</p>
    
            <p>The following is a video of “Wired in Series”, the resulting

            Innovation Grant Award. None of the students had composed music
            before taking this course.</p>
